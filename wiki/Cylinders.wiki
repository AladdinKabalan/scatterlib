==Barber and Hill codes for scattering by an cylinder at normal incidence==

These codes were published in "Light Scattering by Particles: Computational Methods", P.W. Barber and S.C. Hill, 1990 by World Scientific Publishing. There are seven computer programs which may be used to calculate the light scattered by a cylinder when a plane wave is incident perpendicular to the cylinder axis.  One auxiliary program calculates test results using the small-particle approximation.  A second auxiliary program determines array dimensions for the seven basic programs.

The source code is available here [http://scatterlib.googlecode.com/files/barber.zip barber.zip].

Notice that c6.for and c7.for calculate near field intensity.
